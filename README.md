# Heart disease prediction 

This project develops a machine learning model to predict heart disease risk using health and lifestyle data, enabling early intervention. By merging two datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE, the project achieves high predictive performance with XGBoost. Predictive tools are crucial for identifying individuals at higher risk of developing heart disease. This allows early intervention or prevention.

## Results

XGBoost achieved the highest performance with a ROC_AUC of 0.92 and F1-score of 0.89, outperforming other models.

Key features (e.g. cholesterol levels, age) were identified as top predictors through feature importance analysis.

Visualizations and EDA revealed patterns in health metrics, supporting data-driven insights.
